# Modelling the first viral bank run: analysis of the spread of information about Silicon Valley Bank on Reddit

This group project comes is part of the Simulation and Modelling course from Bocconi's MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics ([DSBA](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/data-science-and-business-analytics)).

## Abstract
The world of social networks holds immense power in shaping the spread of information and ideas, including the potential for viral bank runs that can disrupt the financial sector. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of information diffusion on SVB’s bank run within the r/Economics subreddit. Through a mathematical model and network analysis, we uncover how Reddit serves as a conduit for the propagation of crucial financial information. The research seeks to explore this new phenomenon in order to enhance regulatory measures to prevent future bank runs, improve crisis communication plans of financial institutions, and uncover the potential of monitoring social media platforms for early indications of bank runs. Our research models information diffusion as an epidemic using compartmental models like S.I.R. and S.E.I.R. However, these models demonstrate to only partially capture the phenomenon. To improve our understanding, we suggest using more advanced models more suitable to capture individuals’ behaviour.
